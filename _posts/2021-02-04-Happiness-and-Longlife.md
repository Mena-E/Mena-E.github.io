>The goal of this study was to investigating if people living in countries with more women in parliament or cogress, have a higher average life expectancy and higher average happiness score than people in countries with fewer women in congress. My final dataframe had 160 countries. Two main questions were answered in this project.

>For the first question I investigate whether the countries in the dataset with a higher percentage of women in congress have a higher average life expectancy than the countries with a lower percentage of women in Parliament. I split the observations into two groups, one higher and the other lower percenatge of women in Parliamnent, took the mean of their life expectancies, then did a two sample t-test to obtain a p-value. I found that the difference of the mean life expectancies were statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha significance level. So I rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that people in countries with a higher percentage of women in congress most likely also have a higher avetage life expectancy.

>For the second question, I tested whether countries with higher percentages of women in Parliament have a higher happiness score on average when compared with their counterparts. The methodology for answering this second question was the same as the first. I found that the difference in means of the happiness scores was statisitically significant at the 0.05 alpha significance level. So I again rejected the null hypothesis, and conluded that people in countries with a higher percentage of women in congress most likely also have a higher average happiness score.

>As a bonus, I conducted a Linear Regression using the OLS model to check if there is a relationship between Life Expectancy and Happiness score. I found the two variables were mildly, but positively related. This relationship is shown in the animated bubble chart below, with the larger bubbles representing countries with a high percentage or level of women in parliament, while the smaller bubbles are for countries with a low level of women in parliament.
